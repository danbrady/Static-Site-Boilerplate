Placing any PNG, GIF, JPG, or SVG files into this folder will trigger a grunt task to create a compressed copy in 'images/' and will also maintain directory hierarchy.

Example:
* `images/_uncompressed/images.png` --> `images/images.png`
* `images/_uncompressed/directory/image.png` --> `images/directory/image.png`
